    <content type="text"><![CDATA[​ Gaussian function is : ​ $f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}}$ ​ For sake of simplicity, we consider the following form: ​ $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$ ​ It is an “obvious” conclusion that is taken for granted by many people that gaussian’s fourier transformation is still in gaussian form. An often seen proof is as follows: ​ $F(w) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)e^{-iwx}dx$ ​ $ = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-(x^2+iwx)}dx$ , using $ x^2 + iwx = (x + \frac{iw}{2})^2 - \frac{w^2}{4}$ ​ $= e^{-\frac{w^2}{4}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-(x + \frac{iw}{2})^2}dx$ ( by substituting $x$ with $u=x+\frac{iw}{2}$ ) ​ $= e^{-\frac{w^2}{4}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-u^2}du$ ​ $= \sqrt{\pi}e^{-\frac{w^2}{4}}$ ​ Proved. ​ ​ Is the proof correct? Anything wierd? ​ Here is the problem : why does these two expression give the same result : ​ $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-(x + \frac{iw}{2})^2}dx$ (1) ​ equal to ​ $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-u^2}du$ (2) ​ ??? ​ In expression (1), the integral region is from $-\infty$ to $\infty$ ,confined in real number field, whereas in expression (2) the variable $u$ is a complex number with non-zero imaginary part, and for a complex number with non-zero imaginary part, $\infty$ is meaningless because it is a concept of real number field! Hence the form of expression (2) is in fact invalid (even it still leads to right answer) ! ​ Thus, the above proof is inaccurate. And for an accurate proof, complex integeral knowledge is required, instead of the trivial substitution forementioned. ​ Usually a complex integral a path integral. It is a generalization of real number integral, and integral in real number field actually corresponds to the path integral along the $x$ axis in the complex plane. ​ Here I assume that the readers have the basic knowledge of computation of complex integral. It’s time to apply the very classical and beautiful theorem in complex integral. Cauchy’s integral theorem： ​ $\oint{f(z)dz} = 0$ ​ , where $z$ is a complex number and $f(z)$ is holomorphic. ​ Function $f(z) = e^{-z^2}$ is holomorphic anythere in the complex plane, thus: ​ $\oint{e^{-z^2}dz} = 0$ (3) ​ is safistied along any loop path in the complex plane. We choose to conduct the integral in the following rectangular loop: ​ As drawn, the four edges of the rectangle are $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$. The “height” and “width” of the rectangle is $\frac{w}{2}$ ( as comparison to expression (1) )and $2a$, where both $w$ and $a$ are real numbers. Thus expression (3) can be splitted into four parts: ​ $\oint{e^{-z^2}dz} = \int_{A}{e^{-z^2}dz} + \int_{B}{e^{-z^2}dz} + \int_{C}{e^{-z^2}dz} + \int_{D}{e^{-z^2}dz} = 0$ ​ Furthure, by separting $z$ into $x+iy$, we have: ​ $\int_{A}{e^{-z^2}dz} = \int_{a}^{-a}{e^{-z^2}dz} = \int_{a}^{-a}{e^{-x^2}dx}$ ​ $\int_{B}{e^{-z^2}dz} = \int_{-a}^{-a+ib}{e^{-z^2}dz} = \int_{0}^{b}{e^{-(-a+iy)^2}dy} = e^{-a^2}\int_{0}^{b}{e^{y^2+i2ay}}dy$ ​ $\int_{C}{e^{-z^2}dz} = \int_{-a+ib}^{a+ib}{e^{-z^2}dz} = \int_{-a}^{a}{e^{-(x+ib)^2}dx}$ ​ $\int_{D}{e^{-z^2}dz} = \int_{a+ib}^{a}{e^{-z^2}dz} = \int_{b}^{0}{e^{-(a+iy)^2}dy} = e^{-a^2}\int_{b}^{0}{e^{y^2-i2ay}}dy$ ​ Imagine that $a$ goes to $\infty$ , it can be easily deduced that $\int_{B}$ and $\int_{D}$ goes to zero. ​ Finally, we have: ​ $\lim_{a \to \infty} (\int_{a}^{-a}{e^{-x^2}dx} + \int_{-a}^{a}{e^{-(x+ib)^2}dx} ) = 0$ ​ , which is : ​ $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{e^{-x^2}dx} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{e^{-(x+ib)^2}dx}$ ​ PROVED.]]></content>
